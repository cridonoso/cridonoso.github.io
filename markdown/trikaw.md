This is an important and ambitious project whose goal is to make AI understand political content in real-time and inform people about complex processes in a friendly way.

We will take advantage of LLM (Large Language Model) agents together with advanced software tools to create a virtual ecosystem where we can build free and open-source products.

### Early look
Making AI understand political information is not an easy task. <b>LLMs (Large Language Models) have demonstrated a very good ability to generate text. However, they also have the ability to hallucinate.</b> Socializing politics cannot result in misinforming people with fake conclusions.

We <b>propose a relational database encoding the logic of our Chilean political system</b>, including relationships between entities.

Using <b>structured data</b>, we want an LLM to understand and create content by using that information exclusively. Even though the model was trained on millions of unrelated content, <b>the answers should be limited by the available information in our database</b>.
