 ## <p style="text-align: left;">A transformer pre-trained model for light curve representation</p>

The Astromer project aims to create a pre-trained foundational model for light curve representation. In collaboration with the Universidad de Concepci√≥n and the Institute of Applied Computation Sciences at Harvard, this project was inspired by the success of Large Language Models to develop a novel approach for embedding and representing light curve data.

### How does it work?
Similar to text embeddings, Astromer can create embeddings for raw light curves from sequences of observations taken by telescopes in a particular moment (_see image bellow_).

The shape of the light curve characterizes the astronomical object. Astronomers usually extract statistical and physical features from the time series data to categorize objects into classes. <b>Astromer can do it automatically in a self-supervised way!</b>
<br><br>
Astromer optimizes an attention-based encoder to predict masked values that are randomly chosen.

<b>The model must look at the context</b> to predict the hidden elements. If the model can predict using the information around, then we can say <b>the model has understood the domain.</b>
</i></p>  

The Astromer training pipeline is as follows:
1. <b>Collect large amounts of data</b> from public astronomical datasets
2. Format the data to efficiently <b>manage it on GPU/CPU memory</b>
3. Randomly choose mask positions within the sequence
4. Feed the masked sequence into the Astromer model
5. <b>Predict</b> the values for the masked observations
6. Compute the root-mean-square error between the predicted and real values
7. <b>Backpropagate</b> the error through the Astromer model to update the weights"
