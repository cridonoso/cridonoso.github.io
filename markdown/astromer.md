 ## <p style="text-align: left;">A transformer pre-trained model for light curve representation</p>
 
The Astromer project aims to create a pre-trained foundational model for light curve representation. In collaboration with the Universidad de Concepci√≥n and the Institute of Applied Computation Sciences at Harvard, this project was inspired by the success of Large Language Models to develop a novel approach for embedding and representing light curve data.

### How does it work?
