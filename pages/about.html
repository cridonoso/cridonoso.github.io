						I'm a very curious person who always wants to learn new things. 
						Working with data is perfect for me because it lets me collaborate with experts in different subjects, 
						learn about their fields, and apply my knowledge to help them. 
						Bringing together ideas and methods from different areas is what I find most rewarding.

					Hello! My name is Cristobal Donoso-Oliva, and <b>I'm a computer scientist living in Concepci√≥n, Chile</b>.

					My background is in <b>software engineering</b>, with a focus on working with data and AI. 
					I have a <b>master's degree in computer science</b>, where I specialized in studying irregular and messy astronomical data. 
					<br><br>
					Throughout my career, I've been lucky enough to travel to other countries, both for <b>research</b> and to present my work 
					at <b>conferences</b>. I've also had experience as a <b>lecturer, teaching assistant, thesis co-supervisor, and evaluator</b>.
					<br><br>
					<b>Studying astronomy has been the best way for me to learn the latest techniques in literature</b>. 
					Dealing with large databases and tricky problems has helped me develop skills that 
					I've been able to use in other fields, like text analysis.			
					<br><br>
					I'm excited to keep exploring the world of data science and to connect with others who share 
					my passion for using technology to drive innovation and discovery. 
					Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss potential ways we could work together.
