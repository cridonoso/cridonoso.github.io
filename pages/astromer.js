<h2><p style="text-align: left;">A transformer pre-trained model for light curve representation</p></h2>
<p>The Astromer project aims to create a pre-trained foundational model for light curve representation. In collaboration with the Universidad de Concepci√≥n and the Institute of Applied Computation Sciences at Harvard, this project was inspired by the success of Large Language Models to develop a novel approach for embedding and representing light curve data.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Similar to text embeddings, Astromer can create embeddings for raw light curves from sequences of observations taken by telescopes in a particular moment (<em>see image bellow</em>). 
 <p align="center"><img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="https://github.com/cridonoso/cridonoso.github.io/blob/master/figures/astromer/lc.png?raw=true" width=480 height=350></p> 
The shape of the light curve characterizes the astronomical object. Astronomers usually extract statistical and physical features from the time series data to categorize objects into classes. <b>Astromer can do it automatically in a self-supervised way!</b>
<br><br>
Astromer optimizes an attention-based encoder to predict masked values that are randomly chosen. 
<br><br></p>
<p style='text-align: right;'><i>
<b>The model must look at the context</b> to predict the hidden elements. If the model can predict using the information around, then we can say <b>the model has understood the domain.</b>
</i></p>  

<p>The Astromer training pipeline is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Collect large amounts of data</b> from public astronomical datasets</li>
<li>Format the data to efficiently <b>manage it on GPU/CPU memory</b></li>
<li>Randomly choose mask positions within the sequence</li>
<li>Feed the masked sequence into the Astromer model</li>
<li><b>Predict</b> the values for the masked observations</li>
<li>Compute the root-mean-square error between the predicted and real values</li>
<li><b>Backpropagate</b> the error through the Astromer model to update the weights&quot;</li>
</ol>
